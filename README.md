# mtconnect-sysml-model

MTConnect Information Model in SysML as per the MTConnect Standard Version 2.3.

MTConnect is a well-established semantic vocabulary for factory equipment. The information model for MTConnect is being documented in SysML to allow easier portability, faster deployment, and better integration and interoperability with other standards and protocols.

# What's Included

The model is available in the following formats:
1. Cameo Enterprise Architect model (.mdzip)
2. XMI
3. HTML: WebReport 2.0 (Deploys as is with most web browsers except Chrome. To open with Chrome, see https://docs.nomagic.com/display/MD185/Web+Publisher+2.0+report). This replicates the model view and layout as is.
4. HTML: WebReport SoftwareEngineeringPortal (Deploys as is with all web browsers). It includes a search bar for terms. The layout is slightly different.

# Getting Started

Users should be familiar with MTConnect version 1.8 by browsing the complete MTConnect standard or by referring back to the standard while exploring the SysML model/XMI.
